# FSH modelling course - animal registry

Welcome to the FSH (FHIR Shorthand) Modelling Course! This implementation guide demonstrates fundamental FSH concepts using an animal registry system.

## Learning objectives

By working through this project, you will learn how to:

- Create Profiles with various constraints
- Create and use CodeSystems and ValueSets
- Define Extensions (both simple and complex)
- Build Examples and Instances
- Write Invariants for validation
- Structure and build Implementation Guides

## Course theme: animal registry system

This course uses a veterinary animal registry as the teaching domain. We'll model:

- Different types of animals (dogs, cats, birds, etc.)
- Animal characteristics (breed, weight, color, etc.)
- Conservation status for wildlife
- Relationships between animals and their caregivers

## Getting started
